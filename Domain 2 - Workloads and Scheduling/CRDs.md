##### CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs)
A resource in the Kubernetes API is an endpoint that persists a collection of a particular type of object.
For example, several built-in objects, like pods and deployments, are exposed via an endpoint, and the API server manages their lifecycle.
Using CRD on Kubernetes, you are free to define, create, and persist any custom object.
