##### commit in Git
- In Git, each commit is uniquely identified by a commit hash (also known as a SHA-1 hash)
- This hash is a 40-character string composed of hexadecimal digits (0-9 and a-f) that serves as a unique identifier for that specific commit
- Knowing how to retrieve the current commit's hash is essential for various Git operations, such as referencing commits in commands, creating patches, or performing advanced repository management tasks.

##### Commit Hash - e83c5163316f89bfbde7d9ab23ca2e25604af290
- A commit hash is a unique identifier generated by Git for each commit
- It is a 40-character hexadecimal string derived from the commit's content, author information, timestamp, and parent commits.
- Uniqueness: Ensures that each commit can be distinctly referenced.
- Integrity: The hash reflects the commit's content; any change in the commit alters its hash, ensuring the commit's integrity.
- Referencing: Essential for operations like cherry-picking, reverting, and resetting.

#### Method 1: Using 'git log'
- git log command displays or view the commit history. By customizing its output, you can easily retrieve the current commit's hash.
- Identify the Current Commit: The topmost commit in the git log output is the current commit (i.e., the commit HEAD points to).

#### Shortening the Commit Hash
- You can view a shortened version of the commit hash (e.g., first 7 characters) for convenience.

``````sh
git log --pretty=format:"%h - %s" -n 1
# This variation of the git log command will print only the full hash of the last commit to the repository
git log -1 --format=%H
# If you prefer the shortened commit hash …, then just change the %H to %h
git log -1 --format=%h

# in dockerfile build time
docker build -t flask-local-build --build-arg GIT_COMMIT=$(git log -1 --format=%h) .

``````
#### Using git log with Formatting Options
- To display only the commit hash of the latest commit
- -1: Limits the output to the most recent commit.
- --pretty=format:"%H": Formats the output to display only the full commit hash.
- --pretty=format:"%h": Formats the output to display only the short commit hash.
``````sh
git log -1 --pretty=format:"%H"
``````

#### Method 2: Understanding Git Rev-Parse

- 'git rev-parse’ is a versatile command used to parse and query Git references
- The command git rev-parse can do a remarkable number of different things, so you'd need to go through 
- Git references can be branch names, commit IDs, tags, and more.
- The command takes one or more arguments and returns information about the references or objects specified

##### Retrieving the Commit ID
- One of the most straightforward uses of ‘git rev-parse’ is to obtain the commit ID of a given reference.
- Running this command will return the full SHA-1 hash of the latest commit in the current branch
- You can replace ‘HEAD’ with the name of any branch or tag to get the respective commit ID
- --short: Returns a shorter, unique prefix of the commit hash (default is 7 or 8 characters)
- Simplicity: Directly retrieves the commit hash without additional information.
- Scripting-Friendly: Ideal for use in scripts and automation where only the hash is needed.
``````sh
git rev-parse HEAD

# Shortening the Commit Hash
git rev-parse --short HEAD
git rev-parse --short=8 HEAD

# Finding the Branch Name: This command will return the name of the current branch
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD

# Resolving Abbreviated Commit IDs: You can use ‘git rev-parse’ to resolve these abbreviations to their full SHA-1 hashes
git rev-parse 34e45d
``````
#### Example Use in a Script:

``````sh
CURRENT_COMMIT=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
echo "The current commit hash is $CURRENT_COMMIT"

``````

``````sh
