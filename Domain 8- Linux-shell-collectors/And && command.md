##### Using &
The & character is used to run a command in the background, allowing the user to move onto other tasks while the command runs to completion.

``````sh
bigjob &

``````
##### Using && and ||
The && characters will ensure that the command on the right of it will be run if the command on the left of it succeeds and ensures that the second command isnâ€™t run if the first command fails.

``````sh
$ ping 192.168.0.1 && echo router is reachable
router is reachable

``````
##### Using ||
<the || characters have the opposite effect. If the first command is successful, the second will not be run
``````sh
$ [ -d scripts ] || mkdir scripts
$ ls -ld scripts
drwxrwxr-x 2 shs shs 4096 Jul  8 12:24 scripts

``````
